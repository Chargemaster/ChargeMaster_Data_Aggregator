A prospective patient needing non-immediate medical attention may be more
focused on balancing care with financial burden. 

This could be calculating the cost of a one-time procedure along with consistent
medical attention needed like refilling prescriptions, check-ups every X months,
along with looking at where the hospital may be geographically form them (E.g.
They probably don't want to drive hours to a hospital they have to go to
somewhat regualrly). 

While not all CDMs released by hospitals have insurance information, some may
provide cost breakdown based on the insurance the patients have. No hospital
gives you a "quote" for how much it'll cost but this can be used as a means to
gauge potential financial costs directly to the consumer as well.

The user can look at the dashboard, filter by type of service like medical
procedure, check-up, medications, and so on. Can then filter by further methods
like congressional or legislative districts, hospital size, and county location.
They can then see the hospitals fitting the criteria and compare their costs
side to side for the specific services and/or medical goods/attention they may
need.

Procedural Steps:
1. Consumer views dashboard
2. Consumer selects appropriate filter criteria:
    2.1 This can be county location, hospital size, legislative/congressional
    districts, and medical services/goods they may need
3. Consumer can then view the hospitals fitting that criteria
4. From this specified hospital list, they can then compare costs for the
   specific services, procedures, or mix that they need and make their decision.
   4.1 This may be things such as gauging driving distance to cost savings
